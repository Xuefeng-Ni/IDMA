# Defect detection on multi-type rail surfaces via IoU decoupling and multi-information alignment

## Installation

Please refer to [get_started.md](docs/en/get_started.md) for installation.

## Getting Started

Please see [get_started.md](docs/en/get_started.md) for the basic usage of MMDetection.
We provide [colab tutorial](demo/MMDet_Tutorial.ipynb), and full guidance for quick run [with existing dataset](docs/en/1_exist_data_model.md) and [with new dataset](docs/en/2_new_data_model.md) for beginners.
There are also tutorials for [finetuning models](docs/en/tutorials/finetune.md), [adding new dataset](docs/en/tutorials/customize_dataset.md), [designing data pipeline](docs/en/tutorials/data_pipeline.md), [customizing models](docs/en/tutorials/customize_models.md), [customizing runtime settings](docs/en/tutorials/customize_runtime.md) and [useful tools](docs/en/useful_tools.md).

Please refer to [FAQ](docs/en/faq.md) for frequently asked questions.
